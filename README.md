### ðŸ›¡ macOS App Launch Instructions

macOS may block the app from opening because it is not signed by an Apple-verified developer. To bypass this:

1. Download and unzip `The Dot Game.app`
2. Try to open it once â€” click **Cancel** when you see the warning
3. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security**
4. Scroll to the bottom and click **"Open Anyway"**
5. In the next popup, click **"Open"**

macOS will remember this, and the app will open normally from now on.
